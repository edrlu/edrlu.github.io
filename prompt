so for blog have two categories one is just blog and one is education 
so move From φ to Φ: Area Under the Curve and Confidence Intervals into the education
make the categories like blocks on the right side that i can select 

inside the education block have more blocks statistics and machine learning
From φ to Φ: Area Under the Curve and Confidence Intervals should be in statistics
render that blog like how we render our portfolio with blocks and images
and then create a new block visualizing moments which shows different E[mu^x] for visualization
